# Arduino-rc-car
# Ultrasonic Branch #1: 
1) The purpose of this branch is to test out an Ultrasonic Sensor with the Arduino RC Car 
2) Attach the sensor to the front of the Arduino & calibrate
3) Test should be able to move forward UNTIL an object is sensed by the Sensor
4) The RC car should be able to detect an object in front of it, then stop. After, it should 
    turn a direction, check, and then proceed to move forward or turn again!
